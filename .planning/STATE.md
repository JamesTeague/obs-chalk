## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Object model over pixel painting — enables selective deletion and avoids the GPU race that crashes obs-draw
- Source type is OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_INPUT — required for preview mouse interaction and independent overlay positioning; must be correct from first commit
- Qt version must match OBS binary exactly (Qt 6.8.3 in OBS 32.x); link against /Applications/OBS.app/Contents/Frameworks

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Qt version pinning: verify exact Qt subversion by inspecting /Applications/OBS.app/Contents/Frameworks before writing CMakeLists.txt
- Phase 4: macOS codesigning requires Developer ID cert configuration in CI before first public release — plan a spike
